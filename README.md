# Formula Nine Core

__Formula Nine Core__ is an offshoot of the excellent __Silex v2__ framework.
 
The purpose of this split from the Silex repository is to customize the base framework features to harmonize
with the intentions of Formula Nine. Core is not a replacement for Silex - rather, Silex is at the core of
the Formula Nine foundation.

Core differs from Silex in its usage and/or expression of integral components in an attempt to render Silex
more compatible with design aspects of Formula Nine.
